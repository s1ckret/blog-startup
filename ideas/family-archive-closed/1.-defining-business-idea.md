### Task

#### Describe the problem you are going to solve

{% hint style="warning" %}
TL;DR; **Managing a digital photo album manually is hard!**
{% endhint %}

Worldwide, there are approximately 6.84 billion smartphones. An average US citizen takes 20.2 photos per day or 7373 per yer.

These photos are precious memories that should not be lost!

Typically, people use hard drives or cloud storage like Google Drive to store their photo albums. But over time, photo album management becomes a nightmare due to the following problems:

* it takes a lot of time to categorize photos
* it takes a lot of effort to resolve duplicates
* there is a huge fear of losing a photo while managing the album

#### Define your target audience, whom you focus on (very briefly describe)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is my initial vision which will 100% change after customer interview.
{% endhint %}

Families with children under 18 years old, who travel together 1-2 times a year.

:point\_up: They typically take a lot of photos of their children, because family is the most valuable thing for them.&#x20;

:point\_up: They take a lot of photos while traveling, because it is a significant moment in their life.

:point\_up: They rarely (1-2 times a year) look through old photos.

:point\_up: They would like to have an organized photo album, but they have neither the time nor the energy to do so.

#### Describe concisely the solution that is going to solve this problem

A website to which a user uploads their photos, and then the website automatically categorizes the photos and stores them in the cloud, using long-term storage to reduce costs for the user.
