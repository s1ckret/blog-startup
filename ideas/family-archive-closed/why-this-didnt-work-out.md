# Why this didn't work out

## How it all started

It was a cold end of June. I just passed my exams for Masters degree and had a lot of free time after work. I wanted to learn new technologies such as Golang, Svelte, Terraform and obtain a hands-on experience with connecting payment services like Stripe. So I decided to create a demo project to train on. "It will also be a good project for my resume to land a new job as a senior software engineer," I thought at the moment.&#x20;

In July, a friend of mine was searching for a frontend developer job. He didn't have any comertial experience, so I offered him to work with me on the project. I was paying him a Trainee salary for 3 months like a full-time job, because I wanted to encourage him.&#x20;

> Thoughts of a startup begin to creep into my mind...

In late July, I reached out to a developer on the Internet. Twitch streamer Primagean reacted to his post on Medium. I found his experience similar to mine. In his post, he wrote about the difficulties of finding a job at the age of 17. So I invited him to the team and he agreed.

Development went well till September when it all started to slow down. University had started and everyone was busy with their own chores, including me. I think I didn't allocate enough time for the project and I see it as my mistake.

## Incubator program

How did I find out about the program? Well, it was a long and spontaneous journey. After a couple of meetups I subscribed to [CfE Accelerator](https://ucucfe.com.ua/en/) and saw a post for Startup School by Startup Depot. I applied More about you can read here[2023-q4-startup-school-by-startup-depot-family-archive](../../events/2023-q4-startup-school-by-startup-depot-family-archive/ "mention")

## What my startup is and what isn't

I thought of it as a micro business. I didn't expect a unicorn out of it.

### What about the market & problem?

I don't think this it is a painkiller. More like a vitamin.

Plus it heavily relies on Internet. It will take 8 hours to upload 200Gb library.

My calculated SOM is under 1M$. I don't know how fast it grows.

The market doesn't seem to search for the problem solution.

The problem appears once a month, once a 3 month or even once a 6 month. (when a user transfers a photo dump from mobile to PC) (idealy a problem must appear daily or at least weekly)

**After all, I didn't wanted to make a startup out of it.**

P.S. I joined another startup called Gvary as CTO.

P.P.S. Business is all about people.
