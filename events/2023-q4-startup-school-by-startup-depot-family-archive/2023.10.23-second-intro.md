## Meeting

We got to know each other better. It was inspiring to see people who strive to create new startups and solve problems.

## Schedule

The incubator program consists of:

* 7 webinars
* optional 30 min individual mentor meetings
* pitch day

Also, organizers outlined for us the best result that we could achieve during this program:

* analyse the market
* understand the customer
* build MVP
* acquire at least 1 customer

At the end of the program there will be a pitch day, where we can pitch our startups to investors and can receive funding.

## Afterparty

The day before I read "The Mom Test" book and was ready to test my knowdledge on my relatives. So after the meeting I went to my mom and aunt. We had a beautiful conversation about photos, where I got a lot of insights about how they manage their albums. However I also heard a strong signal that they won't use, pay or even search for a solution to a problem, because it is not that of a big problem.
