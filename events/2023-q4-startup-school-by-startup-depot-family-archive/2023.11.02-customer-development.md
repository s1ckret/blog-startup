# 2023.11.02 - Customer development

Talk with people to find out

* their processes (how they work)
* what upsets, scares them
* their pain points
* the common language in which they describe the problem

Focus on

* Process and place
* Urgence of a problem
* How often a problem arises
* Effort and time to solve a problem

Find out about decision making process:

* B2B - has different roles and responsibilities
* B2C - examine how a person selects an app

The most critical questions for a startup on idea phase:

* is there a problem?
* are people willing to pay to solve the problem?

To prepare for customer interview do this:

1. ICP
2. List of hypotheses (yes or no statements)
3. Questions for each of hypotheses

> Different GEO has different culture and perception of a problem. It is important to interview customers from the same GEO as in ICP.

When to stop? Customer development never stops, but for an idea stage startup when the answers begin to repeat itself, then you can start building your project.

> If you can't find people to interview, how will you sell the product?
