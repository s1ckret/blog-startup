# 2023.10.16 - Selection week



Before the meeting I made a landing page for my startup on Sunday. It took me whole day but I was ok with the result - [family-archive.s1ckret.com](https://family-archive.s1ckret.com/).

I was pretty hyped after our first intro meeting, where \~30 people pitched their ideas briefly and a total of \~90 people attended. It was pleasant to see a lot of people with ideas who strive to create something new. Unfortunately, idea is not enough. Execution of this idea is the key.

I introduced myself the next way:

Our tasks for the first week were to

* Complete [a training course on developing your own startup](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLha\_4VLMHaJHCAdUEfsSUAjwSbt0Mr9do)
* Take 11 tests on the course :point\_up:
* Fill out a form about the startup
* Record a 2 minute pitch

The training course was dense, around 70% of information was new to me. I scored 54 out of 55 on the tests. Made the silliest mistake - misread the question :)

After that I recorded my pitch on Oct 19 which took me around 6 hours (from 1pm to 7pm) and \~45 takes. I wanted it to be perfect and I didn't want to read from a screen. In ended up with something in the middle, because the time is more valuable than perfection. [You can watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/O0g8gnRn3Dw).

We were also provided with a list of literature to be read

1. ❗️Rob Fitzpatrick - "The Mom Test"
2. ❗️Eric Rais - "The Lean Startup"
3. Peter Thiel - "Zero to One"
4. &#x20;Stephen Covey - "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"
5. &#x20;Ben Horowitz - "The Hard Thing About Hard Things"

The next week I was on a trip to Kharkiv. While I was on train I read The Mom Test book and it was eye-opening for me. When I met my parents I was able to validate my idea with them and my aunt. After that I realized that they won't buy my product, because they won't pay for the solution and the most important - they don't have the problem. At this moment I started to think that my idea is not a pain killer but rather a vitamin.
